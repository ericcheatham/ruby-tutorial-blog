# Ruby Tutorial Blog

This is the completed Ruby on Rails tutorial blog. I decided to push this out because I wanted a place to go back to and tear apart as I learn more about Ruby on Rails. 

Hopefully this helps you if you learn more like I do :D

To see the tutorial please visit the actual docs at: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
